# Text Retrieval Engine

This repository contains code that can be used to build a text
retrieval engine. It contains the following features:

* Processing of a corpus of documents stored in a single SGML file
using NLTK
* Generating an inverted index of the corpus
* Calculating cosine similarity between a given query and a 
pre-generated inverted index
